// All scripts in this file are (c)GrayWorld 
// THIS FILE IS NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION.
// All NPCs are dressed and speaking with full scripts. Healer scripts are minimal.
// The first few evil monsters have properly set karma type and loot.  I'm working on itemizing all NPCs and karma-adding to all evil beings currently.
// Since item type is not done not all loot and items will work properly.
// Suggestions for improvements welcomed via email nixon@mediaone.net .
// ATT = an average of Damage range as listed in UO Guide.  Commented ATT is the actual Damage range. 
// DEF = an average of Natural Armor range as listed in UO Guide.  Commented DEF is the actual Natural Armor range. 
// ALIGNMENT is only mentioned if the NPC is not Neutral.
// FOOD is what the NPC eats.  "FOOD=MEAT 15 (3)" means the NPC eats 3 bites at a time and is full after consuming 15 units of meat.
// SHELTER definitions (P) Permanent (T) Temporary
// DESIRES definitions (S) Satiable (C) Constant
// SKILL TO TAME - if an NPC is tameable, the taming skill level needed is listed.
