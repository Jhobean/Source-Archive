-------- SphereServer 55R4.0.1 -----------------------------------------

30-05-2004, Kell
- Little fixes to allow compile under Linux (use strcmpi() for caseless string
  comparison, and add casts to (LPCTSTR) on CGStrings).
- Changed version number. I suggest using R4.x.y where xx is increased when
  something major is done and yy is for little changes. Set to R4.0.1.
  (ps: some people never quite understood what RC* means. After the 20th it
   stops being a release candidate, it's more like a candidate to a release
   candidate. So after the "powers that be" have adopted and turned that
   numbering scheme into a mockery, I suggest we change to something less
   confusing.

- Added FORCONT loop, format is FORCONT uid_of_container max_sub_containers. It will loop on every item
  present in the container. If max_sub_containers is not present it will search in all subcontainers. If 
  max_sub_containers = 0 - it will search only in this container. (Thx to Balkon for the base code for
  container loops)

- Made a blank REVISIONS.TXT because it was getting pretty big.
- Added XOR (^) operator to expressions.

12-06-2004, Furio
- Added two new INI value USECRYPT and USENOCRYPT. The first if 0 don't allow at encrypted client to login
  otherwise allow them to log (default is 1). The second if 0 don't allow at unencrypted client to login otherwise
  if 1 -> allow and suppose that the clientversion is >= 2.0.0
  if 2 -> allow and suppose that the clientversion is >= x.x.x
  if 3 -> allow and suppose that the clientversion is >= 3.0.0
  (to use unencrypted client > 4.0.0c you need to enable the Ef_Aos thing)
- Added the most requested security-by-obscurity feature DISGUISEVERSION in sphere.ini. If set change the version
  outputted to clients, ircserver, webserver, listserver, telnetserver to its value otherwise the default build 
  value is used. (Mind that the version in savefile and in console startup is the default build version)
- Fixed (i hope) bug with Mozilla/Firefox browser with the status page
- Fixed a buffer overrun bug that could be exploited to crash or run arbitrary code, in the log system.

- Added ClearTags function (removes all the tags from the char/item/account); Revital did most of the work, but I get the credit.

28-06-2004, Furio
- Fixed multiple gump exploits. In order to do this now memory 08000 is used as internal memory (is called MEMORY_GUMPRECORD).
- Fixed and refined things for disguise version feature.

- Added MODMAXWEIGHT: allows you to increase/decrease max carrying capacity of a char
- Added MODAR: allows you to increase/decrease the overall AR of a char
  NOTE: there are no oStat equivalents (ie oModAr or oModMaxWeight) for the above
- Also added the following to avoid possible confusion:
  * MAXWEIGHT - same as WEIGHTMAX
  * AR - same as AC
  * MODAC - same as MODAR
  * MODWEIGHTMAX - same as MODMAXWEIGHT

- Added 135 more strings (mostly from skills) to sphere_msg.scp
- Added new .ini option: WOOLGROWTHTIME: how long in minutes it takes for wool on sheared sheep to regrow.
- Added new .ini option: SKILLPRACTICEMAX: how high can you train a skill on dummy/archery_target.

04-07-04, kuch
- Added 93 more strings: NPC speech and skill msgs; there are now 329 string messages in sphere_msgs.scp.
- Added TAGCOUNT function (works on regions/items/chars/accounts) - returns the number of tags on that obj
- Fixed CLEARTAGS (now also works on regions)

06-07-04, kuch
- Furio pointed out few problems with MODAR and MODMAXWEIGHT: all relevant functions are not working till I fix them
- Fixed some weird bug in jobmage.scp and jobnoble.scp 
- Added a lot more strings to sphere_msgs.scp; If you find any bugs with them, kuchervano@hotmail.com me immediately!

- Fixed DISTANCEWHISPER not working correctly.

07-07-04, kuch
- Added DEFFOOD value to sphere_defs.scp - this is a template of items you want to get by casting the create food spell
  Yes it does not give you a great deal of control over what you get (ie skillbased for example), but its better than nothing
  
09-07-04, Furio
- Fixed bug with ^ operator.
