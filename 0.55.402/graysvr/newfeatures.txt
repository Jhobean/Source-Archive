Feature Requests:

--------------------------------------------------
High Priority:

save respawning creatures to another file ? to edit quicker in SphereMap and Plotline editor.


--------------------------------------------------
Undecided Priority:

books with pages using auto line measuring 

the ability to spawn or create items based on plevel. Maybe if we could set a tag on each item and NPCs,
 a spawn or create level, then somehow link that to the plevels.  
 I would be more than happy to start doing all the items, and spawns.  
 And then admins could set their shard specific create and spawn levels when they set up their shard.

Some people are far better at making things than others. We are going to try to come up with a grading system. So people who have better scrript contributions are more readily appearant. Scripts that are contributred that just don't work can be fixed or at least identifed as such.

TRUE:  players can use bandages and wands while in hiding mode

Give all monsters a "sphere of detection" so if it's dark it's little likely they will attack you when you walk by them almost a 
 whole screen away. It would be different if you RAN of course *smiles* In light, this sphere of 
 detection of SoD for short *grin* would be much larger. THat is...unless it was monsters who see 
 better in the dark than in daylight....*shivers*

scripts that can contain loops and arrays. Scripts that would pause and wait for a target would be 
especially helpful, too. 

create a ‘Region spawn’ area rect in the map script editor and then create spawns in that rect and have the creatures wander freely without leaving that rect area. Ability to go beyond the border if in war-mode4. Spell mana cost - I'd like to be able to change some of the mana cost of some spells on our server to make them incredibly hard to cast without a high enough intelligence. Ie, make gate almost twice as hard, etc.

Shard Gate .. Some GMs thought it would be cool to be able to have some kind of gate between shards (I would think the player's data would have to be sent between shards?) >>> There’s an ongoing debate about intershard gates…. IT’S an evolving concept…you probably won’t see something for a while though. NOTE: DreamGate code started, not effective yet. 

Newbie books that represent new skills. - skill book system ?

	Horse Thieveing:
Make it possible to "steal" a horse with stealing skill. Upon doing so, the horsethief would be FRIENDED to the horse (not put as new owner) and could thus ride it or command it....since the thief is only friended to the horse there's also a chance that the original horse owner can find his old horse and retrieve it. 

False Criminal: criminal flag lasting longer than 3 minutes. only to those that where personally offended.

12) people are hijacking NPC's with their spells gate travel, I believe that you need to put a block in
 for NPC's traveling through gates unless they are ridden or tamed... OSI had this same problem... 
 I am finding players with their own town and village with bankers, mages and so forth....

 low int walks into gates. unless following.
  
14) interupption for skill use.. for example,
 if you are healing someone and someone attacks you, the healing should be interuppted...
Also like if you are casting a summon deamon or even a heal, and someone hits you with a sword 
or casts a spell on you, that should interrupt the spell, and you should have to start all 
over again with the casting.
  
15) If anyone casts a Blade Spirit, Deamon or EV in town, they should be flagged 
a criminal immediately... Then if the BS, EV or Deamon attacks and kills another player,
 then they should get the murder count.

11. TRUE-(?client bug?)  although I have over 70,000 gold when buying from a vendor it tells me in only have 5,000 

7. there is still a text limit when crafting items - depending on how long the item name is ur name gets cut off (for example - platemail helm crafted by Ser)
ItemID will tell you who crafted gm item.

Sending a message to the console to be recorded in the logs, yet not shown to the player. 
IE, "time:ScriptNotice:Character 'Bob' has begun a quest"

Server run time corruption checking. If const stuff is changed (data, code) the server will notify/exit.

Visual debugger. break at script/line# (Support Microsoft® Windows® Active Script Interfaces)
	(http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/debugger/dbdocs.htm)
	list of break points, step through code. query variables. current UID object.

GM PAges in the console and web pages.
